### The number one HBCU, Spelman College, is a women's college in Atlanta, Georgia. Spelman began its life in the basement room of an Atlantean church as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, the counterpart to its brother school, Morehouse College, which was then called the Atlanta Baptist Seminary. The illustrious college is deeply rooted in its history and traditions. The college has also been recognised as the leading producer of black, female PhDs. As students make their "choice to change the world, they are afforded a wide array of majors and academic opportunities as well as a bustling and engaging student life. Nestled in the heart of Atlanta, there is no limit to the social interactions (!!!!HELP Rephrase!!!!) available to students as they enter the gates.
