## Spelman College
### The number one HBCU, Spelman College, is a women's college in Atlanta, Georgia. Spelman began its life in the basement room of an Atlantean church as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, the counterpart to its brother school, Morehouse College, which was then called the Atlanta Baptist Seminary. The illustrious college is deeply rooted in its history and traditions. The college has also been recognised as the leading producer of black, female PhDs.
